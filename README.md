# VisionAlert
VisionAlert is a modular crowd surveillance and control system using ESP32-CAM for vision, PS4 controller for servo control, esp-32 for buzzer and OLED feedback, and Twilio API for SMS alerts. Designed for hackathons and real-world deployment, it detects crowd density and triggers alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
